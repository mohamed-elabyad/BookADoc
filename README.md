## Overview

BookADoc streamlines the process of finding and booking medical appointments. Patients can browse doctors by specialty, schedule appointments online, communicate directly with healthcare providers, and complete payments securely. Doctors manage their schedules, review appointments, and interact with patients through a dedicated portal.

### Architecture Highlights

**Dual-Role Authentication System**
```
User Model (Base)
├── Regular User Role (Patients)
└── Doctor Role
    └── Doctor Model (Extended Profile)
```
Users can register as patients or doctors with separate authentication flows. The `becomeDoctor()` method elegantly handles role transformation while maintaining data integrity.

**Eloquent Relationships**
The database schema leverages Laravel's powerful ORM with well-defined relationships:
- Users ↔ Doctors (One-to-One)
- Doctors ↔ Appointments (One-to-Many)
- Users ↔ Appointments (One-to-Many)
- Appointments ↔ Payments (One-to-One)
- Users ↔ Conversations ↔ Doctors (Chat system)
- Conversations ↔ Messages (One-to-Many)

**Enum-Driven Design**
Type-safe enumerations for critical data:
- `SpecialtyEnum` - 8 medical specialties (Cardiology, Dermatology, Neurology, Pediatrics, Orthopedics, Psychiatry, Dentistry, Ophthalmology)
- `StatusEnum` - Appointment states (Pending, Confirmed, Cancelled, Completed)
- `PaymentStatusEnum` - Payment tracking (Pending, Confirmed, Failed)
- `PaymentMethodEnum` - Payment types (Cash, Card)
- `RoleEnum` - User roles (User, Doctor, Admin)

**Observer Pattern Implementation**
Model observers handle complex business logic:
- `AppointmentObserver` - Triggers notifications on status changes
- `DoctorObserver` - Manages doctor activation workflow
- `PaymentObserver` - Coordinates payment confirmations with appointments
- `UserObserver` - Handles user registration events

**Service Layer Architecture**
- `StripeService` - Encapsulates all payment processing logic including checkout session creation, webhook handling, and payment confirmation
- `ChatService` - Manages conversation creation and message broadcasting

**Notification System**
10 custom notification classes covering the entire user journey:
- User notifications: Payment status, appointment confirmations
- Doctor notifications: New appointments, account activation status
- Automated reminders for upcoming appointments

### Database Schema

**Core Tables**
- `users` - Unified authentication for patients and doctors
- `doctors` - Extended profiles with specialties, licenses, working hours
- `appointments` - Booking records with date/time and status tracking
- `payments` - Financial transactions with Stripe metadata
- `conversations` - Chat threads between doctors and users
- `messages` - Individual chat messages with read status

**Indexes & Optimization**
- Foreign key constraints for referential integrity
- Timestamps for audit trails
- Soft deletes available where appropriate

### API Routes & Endpoints

**Public Routes**
- `GET /doctors` - Browse doctor listings with filters
- `GET /doctors/{doctor}` - View doctor profile details

**Patient Routes** (Auth Required)
- `POST /doctors/{doctor}/appointments` - Book appointment
- `GET /user/appointments` - View user's appointments
- `DELETE /user/appointments/{appointment}` - Cancel appointment

**Doctor Routes** (Auth + Doctor Role Required)
- `GET /doctor/appointments` - View doctor's appointments
- `PATCH /doctor/appointments/{appointment}` - Update appointment status
- `PATCH /doctor/appointments/{appointment}/confirm-cash-payment` - Mark cash payment as received
- `GET /profile`, `PATCH /profile` - Manage doctor profile

**Chat Routes** (Auth Required)
- `GET /chat` - List conversations
- `POST /chat` - Create new conversation
- `GET /chat/{conversation}` - View conversation messages
- `POST /chat/{conversation}/messages` - Send message
- `PATCH /chat/{conversation}/read` - Mark conversation as read

**Payment Routes**
- `POST /appointments/{appointment}/checkout` - Create Stripe session
- `POST /stripe/webhook` - Handle Stripe webhooks (unprotected CSRF)

### Filament Admin Panel

The admin dashboard provides comprehensive platform management:

**Resources**
- User Management - Full CRUD with role assignment
- Doctor Management - Profile review, credential verification, activation controls
- Appointment Management - Status tracking, filtering by date/doctor/patient
- Payment Management - Transaction monitoring, status updates

**Widgets**
- `StatsOverview` - Key metrics (total users, appointments, revenue)
- `AppointmentsChart` - Visual trends over time
- `AppointmentsStatusChart` - Status distribution (Pie/Donut chart)
- `PaymentsChart` - Revenue tracking
- `PaymentStatusChart` - Payment success rates
- `LatestDoctors` - Recent doctor registrations

### Real-time Features

**Broadcasting Setup**
Using Pusher with private channels for secure communication:
```php
MessageSent Event → broadcasts on Private Channel → updates recipient UI in real-time
```

**Echo Configuration**
Frontend listens to private channels with automatic reconnection and presence detection.

### Payment Flow

1. Patient creates appointment → Payment record created (Pending)
2. User clicks "Pay Now" → `StripeService::createCheckoutSession()`
3. Stripe Checkout page → User completes payment
4. Stripe webhook fires → `WebhookController::handle()`
5. `StripeService::confirmPayment()` → Updates payment status & appointment status
6. Notifications sent to both patient and doctor

**Currency Handling**
The system accepts payments in EGP but processes through Stripe in USD using a configurable exchange rate.

### Security Features

- CSRF protection on all state-changing routes (except webhooks)
- Role-based middleware (`auth`, `user`, `doctor`)
- Authorization gates for sensitive operations (e.g., `checkout` gate)
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Database session storage
- Secure Stripe webhook signature verification

### Setup & Installation

Update `.env` with your database credentials:
```env
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_DATABASE=bookadoc
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=
```

5. **Configure Stripe**
Add your Stripe keys to `.env`:
```env
STRIPE_KEY=your_publishable_key
STRIPE_SECRET=your_secret_key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret
```

6. **Configure Pusher**
Add your Pusher credentials to `.env`:
```env
BROADCAST_CONNECTION=pusher
PUSHER_APP_ID=your_app_id
PUSHER_APP_KEY=your_app_key

```

10. **Start Development Servers**
```bash
composer dev
```
This runs the web server, queue worker, and Vite dev server concurrently.
